## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Milestone]: Correct only demonstrated stabilization defects; no general refactors or new features.
- [Phase 1]: Preserve unsupported `RMA_Raids` values and fail closed through explicit quarantine.
- [Phase 2]: Canonical map-ID resolution is the only raid-admission source of truth.
- [Phase 3]: Add application-level request limits without changing version-5 wire formats.
- [Phase 4]: Manual in-game smoke tests are part of milestone acceptance.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Lua-backed automated tests cannot run in the current Codex environment until a Lua 5.1-compatible executable is available; keep this environment limitation distinct from product failures.
- Combat lockdown, taint, localized-client behavior, SavedVariables reload, and multi-client synchronization require in-game verification.
