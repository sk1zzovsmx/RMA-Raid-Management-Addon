# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-15)

**Core value:** Raid-critical data and workflows must remain correct, recoverable, and compatible on WotLK 3.3.5a clients.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Persistence Safety

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Persistence Safety)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress - ready for Plan 01-03
Last activity: 2026-08-15 - Completed Plan 01-02 degraded archive bootstrap

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 9 min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 | 2 | 18 min | 9 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 10 min, 8 min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Milestone]: Correct only demonstrated stabilization defects; no general refactors or new features.
- [Phase 1]: Preserve unsupported `RMA_Raids` values and fail closed through explicit quarantine.
- [Phase 2]: Canonical map-ID resolution is the only raid-admission source of truth.
- [Phase 3]: Add application-level request limits without changing version-5 wire formats.
- [Phase 4]: Manual in-game smoke tests are part of milestone acceptance.
- [Phase 01]: Only nil RMA_Raids initializes a canonical archive; every non-nil value is preserved for validation. — Unknown, future, malformed, and incorrectly typed SavedVariables must remain recoverable.
- [Phase 01]: The store-facing archive error is a stable quarantine category; validator detail remains separate and transient. — DBRaidStore needs a stable fail-closed reason while bootstrap diagnostics need non-user-facing detail.
- [Phase 01]: Bootstrap stores only stable archive category and optional format version in transient addon.State. — Validator detail remains debug-only and no quarantine flag is persisted.
- [Phase 01]: Emit the localized quarantine warning only after degraded bootstrap commits successfully. — Unrelated features initialize normally and blocked history operations do not repeat the global warning.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Lua-backed automated tests cannot run in the current Codex environment until a Lua 5.1-compatible executable is available; keep this environment limitation distinct from product failures.
- Combat lockdown, taint, localized-client behavior, SavedVariables reload, and multi-client synchronization require in-game verification.
